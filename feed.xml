  &lt;li&gt;1 1/2 c. sugar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 large eggs&lt;/li&gt;

Add vanilla and mix until combined.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In another large bowl whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt. Add flour mixture to the wet ingredients, beating until just combined. Pour in the buttermilk and lemon juice and mix until fully incorporated. Add lemon zest and and poppy seeds and stir until just combined.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pour batter into prepared baking pan. Bake until slightly golden on top and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Remove from pan and let cool completely.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a large bowl, beat together cream cheese and butter until light and fluffy. Add powdered sugar, vanilla, lemon juice, and salt and beat until smooth.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 orange bell peppers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;extra-virgin olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;kosher salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Freshly ground black pepper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 Onion, finely chopped&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 garlic cloves, minced&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tsp. chili powder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 lb. ground beef&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 c. cooked white rice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 c. chicken stock, divided&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 (15 oz) can fire-roasted tomatoes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 c. shredded Monterey Jack, divided&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 1:00&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prep Time:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Servings:&lt;/strong&gt; 4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;procedure&quot;&gt;Procedure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preheat oven to 350°.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cut off (and reserve) the top of each pepper. Remove and discard the cores and seeds. Using a sharp paring knife, carve a Jack O’Lantern face into each pepper. Drizzle the inside of each pepper with olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper. Place the peppers upright in a large baking dish along with the pepper tops.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a large nonstick skillet. Sauté onions until soft, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add beef and sauté until browned and cooked through, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon. Turn off the heat and drain the fat.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Return skillet to stovetop over medium heat. Season with salt and pepper to taste and stir in the chili powder. Add the fire-roasted tomatoes, 1/2 cup chicken stock, cooked rice and 3/4 cup of cheese. Stir until the mixture is evenly combined.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Divide rice and beef mixture between the hollowed out peppers. Top with cheese.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pour remaining 1/2 cup chicken stock into pan. Cover with foil and bake for about 30 minutes. Remove the foil and cook for another 10-15 minutes, until the peppers are tender and the cheese is melted.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;small-tables&quot;&gt;Small Tables&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two people from Namma Samayal visited there and the first thing we noticed that was the tables were really small. We first picked a table at center and one of us being 6 feet couldn’t fit our leg in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moved to a table in side and that was okay. We noticed that the dining area on table was small. It was probably that the tables were small, that the water jugs were not placed on them. Instead as you drink, if some waiter notices that your tumbler is empty (a bit), he tops it up, and this does not happen regularly as you may wish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bad-mouthed-waiters-and-supervisor&quot;&gt;Bad mouthed waiters and supervisor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a guy and a girl right next to our table. Looks like they did not finish all on their plate, the waiter who was taking out the plate complained about it after they left. Thats a bad behavior. Waiters should never complain about customers before other customers, particularly if the other customer is a blogger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The supervisor too is a person who  was in a bad mood. He shouted at waiter right in the dining area before customers. That too is bad. It gives a feeling that the management is not treating their employees well enough and hence its adding work pressure to them. Would you like to eat in a hotel where the workers are treated bad?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hotel-ambiance&quot;&gt;Hotel Ambiance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hotels ambiance is okay, when we went the hotel wasn’t crowded, possibly because of that the noise levels were low. The cooling was good enough, we did not have waiters asking “you want bottled water or ordinary” so that a profit can be made from selling a pricey bottle. Every thing looked neat except the the tissue paper dispenser in the wash room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;food&quot;&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am mixed about the food, let me tell you why. We ordered these three items&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Half Tandoori Chicken&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nawab Sheik Special Chicken Briyani&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iraqui Briyani (with mutton in it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tandoori-chicken&quot;&gt;Tandoori Chicken&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/nawab_sheikh_tandoori_chicken.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tondoori chicken was like tandorri chicken in any other hotel. You can even get a better tasting one in a road side shop, this is not to say that it was bad, it was okay, but nothing special about it. It came with a green chutney and onions sliced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all hotels, the tandoori had food color added to it, personally we feel that good hotels must concentrate on taste than about looks of food. A true foodie will eat a tandoori thats brown and black rather than one  degraded with red food color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nawab-sheik-special-chicken-briyani&quot;&gt;Nawab Sheik Special Chicken Briyani&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/nawab_sheikh_special_chicken_briyani_2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This briyani was served a bowl full, the chicken pieces were tiny and was bit spicy compared to the Iraqi briyani we had. It was clearly a designed to be eaten with a spoon, no bones or what so ever was in it. One who is used to bite bones and meat while eating briyani may miss the experience, but this is a high class hotel as per their projection and they feel that customers should be able to eat with spoon and the eating experience should be good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The briyani was great, we were able to eat it without side dish. Thats a hallmark of a good briyani, if it glides into you without any side dish, just by its taste, its a good one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iraqi-briyani&quot;&gt;Iraqi Briyani&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/iraqui_briyani.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iraqi briyani had small pieces of mutton in it. It too was designed to be eaten with a spoon, it came with a piece of chcicken 65, so there was a biteable size of meat. The Iraqi briyani was less spicy compared to the other briayni, it had been garnished with nuts. It tasted well too, went in without the aid of side dish and we loved the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;side-dish-for-briyani&quot;&gt;Side dish for briyani&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The briyani came with three side dishes, one was brinjal preparation, onions in curd or raitha, and a cup with two gulab jamuns. Two people went and we had hard time figuring out weather the gulab jamnuns came with Iraqi briyani or special chicken briyani.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brinjal preparation was quiet horrible. It spoiled the taste of briyani and so we left it off, the raitha was okay, but the briayni’s tasted so well, it could go along without raitha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a foreigner who can’t eat Indian food, the Raitha will come in handy to reduce the spiciness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gulab jamuns were regular gulab jamuns, nothing special about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-mouth-freshener&quot;&gt;The mouth freshener&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever come across a food blogger praising a mouth freshener? Well,  here you do. In Nawab Sheikh, if you say there is something worthy Nawabi I would say its the mouth freshener. It was so good. The person who came with me pocketed two of them. That good it was! You may visit the restaurant once for the mouth freshener. Hats off to Nawab for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-brief&quot;&gt;In Brief&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though, the seating and side dishes are not so good, Nawab Sheikh Palace in Perungudi has good briayni and mouth freshener. An okay place to visit we would say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nammasamayal had been in Sea shell a while ago, and in this blog we wish to talk
about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went on a Saturday, we got a parking for our car quiet easily which was a
surprise. We went to the restaurant upstairs, the first thing we noticed was the
noise. Though Seashell is an expensive restaurant, the noise level was really
high. People were talking all around and there was no noise absorption surface
around. So the ambiance was not what we expected from a good branded restaurant.
In Greames road Sea Shell, we had separating walls that muted sounds a bit,
over here in Velacherry it was open and was disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets come to the food now. We ordered Chicken Briyani, Mutton Briyani and a
barbecue platter (which is shown below)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/seashell_barbeque_platter.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The platter came early before Briyani. I see this trend in today
 where the butlers are told to serve the side dish first. Lets say that I had
 ordered a Mutton Briyani with Chicken 65, the Chicken 65 is served first, so
 I start to chew on it, by the time the briyani arrives, I would be low on the
 side dish and may possibly order another one. Nice trick!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we ordered a huge platter, it had barbecued chicken that was good,
 the prawn and mutton was okay too, but the fish barbecued… well, it wasn’t
 nice. If you notice the chicken it had food coloring, which I don’t like, but
 thats how restaurants serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The barbecue platter also came with barbecued paneer and other veggies, which
 were okay. The barbecues did complement briyani well. I did not taste the
 Chicken Briyani, I had the mutton. The mutton was really soft and good, but
 the briyani, hmmm… it wasn’t good enough, it wasn’t bad either. The best thing
 was a red chutney they give you in a small cup which you can garnish your
 barbecue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall for a restaurant that charges you extra for an extra mayonnaise, Sea Shell
 is only below okay. They could do a lot more for what they charge.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="restaurant" /><category term="review" /><category term="chennai" /><category term="velacherry" /><category term="barbeque" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Review of Kumarakom - Velacherry</title><link href="/restaurant/briyani/review/chennai/velacherry/kerala-cuisine/2018/01/06/review-of-kumarakom-velacherry.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Review of Kumarakom - Velacherry" /><published>2018-01-06T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-01-06T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/restaurant/briyani/review/chennai/velacherry/kerala-cuisine/2018/01/06/review-of-kumarakom-velacherry</id><content type="html" xml:base="/restaurant/briyani/review/chennai/velacherry/kerala-cuisine/2018/01/06/review-of-kumarakom-velacherry.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/mutton_briyani_in_kumarakom_velacherry.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently we went to Kumarakom in Velacherry to see how it is. We ordered few
dishes. We ordered Mutton, Chicken and Egg Briyani. As side we ordered Prawn fry,
Policha Meen, and Chicken 65. So how was it? Read on …..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kumarakom positions itself as a Kerala restaurant, and it has got lot of
decorations in it to reflect Kerala spirit, the hotel looks neat and just like
any restaurant in Chennai, its tables were small. We had to constantly move
plates and other dishes to accommodate the side dish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its serving of briyani is weird. Biyani no matter what type you eat, is served
with an appalam, lemon pickle and raita. Hmmm thats weird to me. But those side
dishes goes well with Briyani, except for the raita which was not upto the mark,
its curd was very bad quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The briyani is served with meat or eggs cooked in thick gravy that goes to the bottom
of the bown and the rice tops it. One needs to mix it well to have it. The
chicken briyani was okay, but the mutton is mutton briyani tasted well but was
not cooked soft. You have to bite and pull it hard with your teeth to tear it
to sizable pieces to eat. Usually briyani is cooked in such a way that the meat
in it is soft and so one can piece it with hand mix it with rice and eat it,
here thats not the case. And mind you this is a high priced restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were amazed that there was no Kushka, and let me explain why. When you eat chicken
briyani, the rice must have chicken flavor, when you eat mutton briyani the rice
must have absorbed the mutton flavor, and similarly for egg too. Here in
Kumarakom, nope we did not get such flavor. Looks like Kumarakom is cooking
chicken, mutton and egg with a thick paste and thats been put in the bottom of the bowl and
topped with cooked rice. the same rice tops what ever paste is added to the
bowl. Well thats not briyani! Thats cheating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now coming to the prawn fry, there were more dry seeds, and masala and other
seasoning and garnish in the plate than prawns. The size of the prawn too was tiny and it
wasn’t that good. The prawn did not have prawn flavor. Possibly it was stored
for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policha meen, i.e the fish cooked inside bannana leaf was ok, it was
tender, the masala had soaked well into the outer layers of the fish and was
crispy, and the inner layers were tender. But if you are looking for the fish flavor
hmmmm… no you did not really get it. It was bad in that respect. The fish had a sour
tasting masala coated on top of it,  which tasted well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally coming to Chicken 65. It was just like any other chicken 65, red in
color, boneless but was cooked well and soft. Well billing itself as hifi
restaurant, is it good to add such coloring? You decide.&lt;/p&gt;

Factory (VFF). Its about a guy named Aarumugam who must be in his late 60’s or
early 70’s. Possibly he is a professional cook. His son takes videos of him
cooking and posts the video on Youtube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People in office gossip that the VFF are from Bodinaayakam area. Aarumugam’s
son first took the first set of videos using a cell phone, at first the video’s
attracted less attention, as time went on the video’s started to get more views
and its said that they earn Rs 4 Lakhs a month just from Ad revenue. Now they
use more professional equipment I was said. I can’t verify its truth, but thats
what people say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cooking is done in way in which most people have forgotten, they use wood
for fuel, they don’t have a stove, they just use three stones or concrete blocks
to rest their vessel over fire. They many times process their own food, for
example they purchase their own ducks, kill them and defeather them just before
cooking. In many Tamilian homes, these art of cooking is lost. The location
they cook too is not like those in 5-star hotels, its among nature and lot of
greens around and on bare earth. Last but not the least, and possibly more
important, they enjoy their own cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cooking video’s not only appeal to people who just cook but people who love
to eat as well. But what we at Namma Samayal like his their attitude. They cook
their food enmasse and distribute it to the poor on the street or orphan
children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just take a look at the video below. They just make muttai puttu, a very very simple
recipe using 1000 eggs. Whats great in that? Nothing. But what they do with what
they have cooked is great. They go about the town and give it away to people
in street. True true Tamilians they are by heart. I am proud of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tandoori chicken is a favorite dish that is served as a stand alone dish or
along with Briyani. It goes well with Mutton Briyani or Kushkaa. If you find
that meat in your briyani is sparse, you may buy a tandoori along with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good thing about Tandoori is unlike Chicken 65 that is fried in oil, this
one uses very less oil. First chicken cut in right places and is marinated in
certain type of masalas for hours, this makes sure the meat become tender, juicy
and absorbs the flavoring. Next the chicken is lowered in coal fired oven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal fire is important as coal has and adds an unique flavor to the dish. Coal
on burning emits no water vapor. Tandoori is formed when water evaporates from
the chicken and is replaced by oils in the chicken. Occasionally the chef might
take the chicken out and brush oil on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here in this blog we are talking about the color of the tandoori. Is it reddish
like the image above or is it brownish as shown below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/tandoori_chicken_right_color.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you say its like the first image you must watch out. To say the truth, food
coloring is no way associated with taste of the food. Its just to make the food
attractive to look. Next there is issue of health, its gossiped that coloring
is not good for health. So who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we advise people is to goto restaurants that serve tandoori in which
natural color, i.e kinda brown comes out and not the fake red. Possibly long
term ingestion of food coloring might prove bad for your health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know a restaurant that serves Tandoori with natural colors? Then do let
people know by commenting.&lt;/p&gt;
