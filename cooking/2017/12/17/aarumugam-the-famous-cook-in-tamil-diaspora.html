  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>During a day in office, I was introduced to a food vlog called Village Food
Factory (VFF). Its about a guy named Aarumugam who must be in his late 60’s or
early 70’s. Possibly he is a professional cook. His son takes videos of him
cooking and posts the video on Youtube.</p>

<p>People in office gossip that the VFF are from Bodinaayakam area. Aarumugam’s
son first took the first set of videos using a cell phone, at first the video’s
attracted less attention, as time went on the video’s started to get more views
and its said that they earn Rs 4 Lakhs a month just from Ad revenue. Now they
use more professional equipment I was said. I can’t verify its truth, but thats
what people say.</p>

<p>The cooking is done in way in which most people have forgotten, they use wood
for fuel, they don’t have a stove, they just use three stones or concrete blocks
to rest their vessel over fire. They many times process their own food, for
example they purchase their own ducks, kill them and defeather them just before
cooking. In many Tamilian homes, these art of cooking is lost. The location
they cook too is not like those in 5-star hotels, its among nature and lot of
greens around and on bare earth. Last but not the least, and possibly more
important, they enjoy their own cooking.</p>

<p>The cooking video’s not only appeal to people who just cook but people who love
to eat as well. But what we at Namma Samayal like his their attitude. They cook
their food enmasse and distribute it to the poor on the street or orphan
children.</p>

<p>Just take a look at the video below. They just make muttai puttu, a very very simple
recipe using 1000 eggs. Whats great in that? Nothing. But what they do with what
they have cooked is great. They go about the town and give it away to people
in street. True true Tamilians they are by heart. I am proud of them.</p>
