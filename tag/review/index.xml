&lt;p&gt;This is Namma Samayalâ€™s experience with A.R.Rahman briyani. We were dining
in Medavakkam restaurant for a long time, the quality used to be near perfect,
but now it has dropped significantly. Notably the amount of meat in chicken
briyani has dropped significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before a chicken briyani used to have nice two huge pieces of meat that was
copious. When we ate we used to have meat in almost every bite, now the meat
has dropped just to  one piece and mostly its the leg piece with little meat
attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When A.R Rahman opened in Medavakkam, it was the place to go, but now it has
become just another restaurant which serves just another medium quality briyani
with very less meat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its quiet sad that restaurant we cherished for briyani has become like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
