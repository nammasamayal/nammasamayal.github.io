   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;During a day in office, I was introduced to a food vlog called Village Food
Factory (VFF). Its about a guy named Aarumugam who must be in his late 60’s or
early 70’s. Possibly he is a professional cook. His son takes videos of him
cooking and posts the video on Youtube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People in office gossip that the VFF are from Bodinaayakam area. Aarumugam’s
son first took the first set of videos using a cell phone, at first the video’s
attracted less attention, as time went on the video’s started to get more views
and its said that they earn Rs 4 Lakhs a month just from Ad revenue. Now they
use more professional equipment I was said. I can’t verify its truth, but thats
what people say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cooking is done in way in which most people have forgotten, they use wood
for fuel, they don’t have a stove, they just use three stones or concrete blocks
to rest their vessel over fire. They many times process their own food, for
example they purchase their own ducks, kill them and defeather them just before
cooking. In many Tamilian homes, these art of cooking is lost. The location
they cook too is not like those in 5-star hotels, its among nature and lot of
greens around and on bare earth. Last but not the least, and possibly more
important, they enjoy their own cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cooking video’s not only appeal to people who just cook but people who love
to eat as well. But what we at Namma Samayal like his their attitude. They cook
their food enmasse and distribute it to the poor on the street or orphan
children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just take a look at the video below. They just make muttai puttu, a very very simple
recipe using 1000 eggs. Whats great in that? Nothing. But what they do with what
they have cooked is great. They go about the town and give it away to people
in street. True true Tamilians they are by heart. I am proud of them.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Color of Tandoori Chicken</title>
   <link href="http://nammasamayal.github.io/tandoori/cooking/food-coloring/2017/12/15/color-of-tandoori-chicken.html"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Chickentandoori.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tandoori chicken is a favorite dish that is served as a stand alone dish or
along with Briyani. It goes well with Mutton Briyani or Kushkaa. If you find
that meat in your briyani is sparse, you may buy a tandoori along with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good thing about Tandoori is unlike Chicken 65 that is fried in oil, this
one uses very less oil. First chicken cut in right places and is marinated in
certain type of masalas for hours, this makes sure the meat become tender, juicy
and absorbs the flavoring. Next the chicken is lowered in coal fired oven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal fire is important as coal has and adds an unique flavor to the dish. Coal
on burning emits no water vapor. Tandoori is formed when water evaporates from
the chicken and is replaced by oils in the chicken. Occasionally the chef might
take the chicken out and brush oil on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here in this blog we are talking about the color of the tandoori. Is it reddish
like the image above or is it brownish as shown below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/tandoori_chicken_right_color.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you say its like the first image you must watch out. To say the truth, food
coloring is no way associated with taste of the food. Its just to make the food
attractive to look. Next there is issue of health, its gossiped that coloring
is not good for health. So who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we advise people is to goto restaurants that serve tandoori in which
natural color, i.e kinda brown comes out and not the fake red. Possibly long
term ingestion of food coloring might prove bad for your health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know a restaurant that serves Tandoori with natural colors? Then do let
people know by commenting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
